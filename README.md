# Apply Patch
1. Click Code
2. Click Download ZIP
3. Extract to game folder and Replace All.

## Future Patching
1. Run GAMEUPDATE.bat to auto patch.

# Troubleshooting
**GAMEUPDATE.bat doesn't update and closes immediately**
1. Make sure your path doesn't contain any Japanese characters or lots of whitespace.
2. Make sure you actually have permissions in the folder

For WOLF RPG games, if you downloaded the game off of DLSite, you will need to do some extra steps to patch it. This is because there is a "master" file called Data.wolf that will take priority over the english patch files. You will need this file to be a folder before patching will work.

# Wolf Games
1) Download the latest UberWolf.exe release from the following link:
https://github.com/Sinflower/UberWolf/releases
2) Drag Data.wolf onto UberWolf.exe. This will create a new folder called data.wolf~
3) Rename the new data.wolf~ folder to Data
4) Delete the Data.wolf file
5) Delete previous_patch_sha.txt (this will exist if you ran GameUpdate.bat previously)
6) Run GameUpdate.bat
